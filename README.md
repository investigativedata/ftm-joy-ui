# ftm-joy-ui

React components based on [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/overview/) for rendering [follow the money](https://followthemoney.tech) stuff.

There have been efforts by the [aleph team](https://github.com/alephdata/) to maintain a `react-ftm` library which eventually got inlined into the main codebase, so this one here is based on the idea of that but not intended to be a replacement. It will not become a real npm "library", just a git repo where common code is collected.

Projects using these components should simply use this repo as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
